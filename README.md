# N-FinFET
creating a N-FinFET structure using the Synospsys sentaurus TCAD tool.
Here we specifically use the SDE tool of sentaurus to create the strucutre of a FinFET.
it is similar to TCL language and helps us in creating accurate structures and with more tools present in Sentaurus we can do extensive analysis of these structures.
